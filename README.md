# Php training for autumn's intership (ULB)

Aim : Code a basic first-one PHP website, to master this techno and go in internship with good bases.

Three big points : 
- SQL Tables : 3 tables : User, Order, Product
- PHP code : safely, easy to use, usable
- CSS : at the end, make it beautifull (a bit...)
